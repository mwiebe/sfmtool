//! The steps the Y sweep and the polar sweep share once each has sorted its
//! features and placed its sliding window.
//!
//! The two sweeps differ in how they order features and slide the window:
//! [`super::sweep`] sorts by Y and reads the window from the sorted keypoints
//! themselves, while [`super::polar`] sorts by angle around the epipole and
//! extends the candidate arrays across the ±π seam. Once a window is placed,
//! both do the same thing with it: optionally narrow it with the geometric
//! filter, take the nearest descriptor among what remains
//! ([`WindowMatcher::best_in_window`]), and after both directions keep the
//! pairs that are each other's nearest ([`mutual_matches`]). Those steps live
//! here so the two sweeps cannot drift apart in them.
